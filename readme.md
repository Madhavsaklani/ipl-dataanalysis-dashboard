# IPL Performance Dashboard 🏏📊

This project analyzes IPL (Indian Premier League) data using Python to understand player and team performance from 2008 to 2020. The goal is to create visual insights using real-world datasets, and build skills in data cleaning, analysis, and storytelling.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📌 Key Analyses (Planned / In Progress)
- Top Run Scorers
This analysis identifies the top 10 batsmen in IPL history based on total runs scored.
Ball-by-ball data was used, and only `batsman_runs` were considered to exclude extras
and accurately measure individual batting performance.

**Key Insight:**
Suresh Raina emerges as the highest run scorer, highlighting his consistency across
multiple IPL seasons. Players like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma closely follow,
indicating long-term performance rather than short peak seasons.
